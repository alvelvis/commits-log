# commits-log

Generate a log of commits from a Github repository using Python3/Jupyter-notebook.

If the commits are related to a specific issue, the log shows the commits in their specific issues tables.

In order to configure the log generator, you simply have to paste the links to the commits you want to count in the log. Other variables are also available in order to customize the log.
